"Hello students and teachers, Hope all of you are safe at home but looking forward to lifting of the lockdown. While there are several online lectures available on internet to keep you engaged, many of you might be wondering if a real lab experience can be made available so that you can quickly try out your ideas at home without the need of going to the lab for testing them out or even trying some of the experiments yourselves to prepare for lab exams. Well, Genie can't really fulfill this wish of ours now but once the lockdown is lifted, we would certainly like to work in that direction. We at Wadhwani Electronics Lab, IIT Bombay have already developed a basic prototype as all-in-one portable lab. But since we consider you as the end users of this board, we would like to take some inputs from you to make the final design. May I request you to please fill up a simple google form at https://forms.gle/eMkskrpjyrHGgS8N6 Thank you very much for your time.. Stay safe and stay healthy, Hope to see you soon through an NPTEL workshop using this board and eventually an online course!! - Wadhwani Electronics Lab Team Department of Electrical Engg IIT Bombay -- You received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups ""Announcements group for Electrical"" group.

Migrate to containers without the manual effort. Learn more Now there’s an easy way to migrate and modernize your existing workloads to containers on a secure and managed Kubernetes service. Your teams can deploy, operate, and maintain existing applications more efficiently and cost-effectively, using the same services, policies, and methodologies of a modern platform. Migrate for Anthos minimizes the manual effort required to move and convert existing applications into containers on Anthos GKE and Google Kubernetes Engine. You can target workloads from virtual machines or physical servers running on-premises, in Compute Engine, or in other clouds. With Migrate for Anthos, you can: Simplify complexity and accelerate migration Automate the extraction of existing applications from servers and VMs into containers, without having to rewrite or re-architect apps. Optimize workload management Save on labor and costs associated with maintaining, patching, and updating VMs and physical servers by switching to modern continuous integration and delivery pipelines, image-based management, and desired-state configuration. Modernize IT landscapes Accelerate the adoption of modern services, such as Anthos Service Mesh, Anthos Config Management, role-based access control, Cloud Logging, and more, while unifying your policy enforcement and management practices across both migrated and newly developed applications. Start your modernization journey by unlocking the power of containers and Kubernetes with Migrate for Anthos.

"How to find the right data for your projects After you create a data project, you’ll want to add the data needed to fuel your research. Try these quick tips to begin. Not rendering correctly? View this email as a web page here . Hi there, Data projects provide a place to work on specific goals and questions with the rest of your team. After you create one, you’ll want to add the data needed to fuel your research. T ry these quick tips to discover and curate the best resources. Search thousands of datasets contributed by government agencies, academic institutions, and others for free, open use. You can also limit your search to the data you've added to the platform. Advanced search operators help find data with specific tags, column headers, extensions, and more. Bookmark things you want to revisit later without having to pause your exploration. They'll be at your fingertips, available in your data library when you need them. And with no limits on the size of your library, curate your collection without worry. Add your favorites to data projects as you find them. Find something that’ll help answer one of your data questions? Simply select “Add to project” and keep browsing for more. You can always remove datasets from your projects later on. Cheers! The data.world team data.world   7000 N.

"Four ways to add data to your projects In addition to exploring free and open data, it’s also easy to securely add your own data and keep it private on data.world. Not rendering correctly? View this email as a web page here . Hi there, In our last email, you learned how to explore the free, open data already available on data.world. It’s also easy to securely add your own data and either keep it private, share it only with your team, or add it to the rich bank of open resources. Here are four ways to do it: Join other data.world datasets to your data project. Add them as you find them or after they’ve been bookmarked and saved in your library. Simply drag and drop any file in nearly any format directly into a dataset. Use ready-to-go integrations to connect with Google Drive, Dropbox, and Box, adding your team's files directly to data projects and datasets. Automatically sync files added from URL — including those requiring authentication. Update your data on demand or automatically refresh files weekly, daily, or hourly. That way, data is ready right when you need it and at a pace that suits your workflow. Ready to try it out? Click here to browse your current data projects, then pick one to add data to. When you're in the project, click the button under the ""DATA SOURCES"" heading to try one of the techniques above. If you haven't added data or started a project yet, don't panic! You can still practice adding data and starting projects in your library anyway. Remember, you can always delete them if you want to try something different. Later, check out this blog post for suggestions on files and resources to add. Cheers! The data.world team data.world   7000 N.
